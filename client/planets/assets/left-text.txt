The handprint is an ancient signature of existenceâ€”both deeply personal and universally shared. It marks identity while dissolving into the vast continuum of human history. Each palm, with its intricate lines and delicate ridges, holds a silent map of experience, a fingerprint of being.

This exhibit explores the tension between individuality and connection. By transforming handprints into expansive forms, we reveal the traces of movement, the marks of presence, and the unseen links that bind us across time. Like planets, our hands hold history, yet find meaning through the gravitational pull of others.
