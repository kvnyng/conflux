Just as galaxies form through the collision of stars, we shape existence through interconnection. The imprints of many hands merge, fusing singular identities into a greater whole—a world born of collective presence. In this act, we are both insignificant and infinite, dust and architects of meaning.

Upon this fragile sphere, we inscribe our existence. Our hands—builders, creators, bearers of touch—become marks upon the unknown. We are both the cartographers and the cosmos, shaping the universe even as it shapes us.
